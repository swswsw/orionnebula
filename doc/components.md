3 components need to be built for the DCU decentralized exchange.  

1. DCU smart contract
- information we still need from nebulas: nebulas token standard.  Is there something like erc20 on nebulas

2. the web ui for user to create buy or sell orders
- the web ui will create and deploy the contract
- uses neb.js and the nebulas chrome extension

3. show the available orders to the user
- uses the api of nebulas full node to find these information.
- information we still need from nebulas: api for nebulas full node.  whether the api can be used to query all contract that are similar to a certain contract.
